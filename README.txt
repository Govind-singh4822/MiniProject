# Student Management Syatem (SMS)





## What is this?

This is a database managament program based on flat file system (.txt) which is designed in C++.
It can perform all CURD opperations based on selected input options. I have used STL library, to be more specific i have used map containers to allow over-writing the same roll numbers and maintain the uniqueness of student roll numbers.
I have implemented admin password in the main menu (Admin123) to enter into the management system.
